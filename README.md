# OpenMuscle Hub

Welcome to the central repository for all OpenMuscle devices, software, and documentation.  
OpenMuscle is a modular, open-source prosthetic sensing platform using pressure and muscle activity to drive machine learning–based control.

This repository serves as the **starting point** for users, contributors, and researchers exploring the OpenMuscle ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

OpenMuscle enables wearable biosensing devices using custom sensors, open firmware, and open hardware. The system is designed for researchers, developers, and prosthetics hackers interested in:

- **Real-time muscle signal acquisition**
- **Machine learning model training (classification/regression)**
- **Experimental prosthetic and robotic control**
- **3D-printable enclosures and modular design**

## 📜 Documentation

📚 Full build guides, videos, and tutorials will be hosted here or at [https://openmuscle.org](https://openmuscle.org).  
This repository will grow into a full documentation hub with instructions for:

- Building each device
- Flashing and configuring firmware
- Training ML models with labeled data
- Mechanical assembly (with 3D-printable STL files)
- Example use cases and integration ideas

📌 **Check each device repo for its specific README and wiring guide.**

## 🛠️ Getting Started

🧪 Want to build a device or contribute?

1. **Choose a device** (e.g. FlexGrid or LASK5) and visit its repo.
2. Follow the hardware build guide in the `/Docs` folder.
3. Flash the firmware from [OpenMuscle-Software](https://github.com/Open-Muscle/OpenMuscle-Software).
4. [Optional] Integrate the data into your own ML workflow.

## 🧩 System Architecture

🧠 OpenMuscle uses a modular architecture:

- Devices like FlexGrid and LASK5 communicate using MicroPython firmware.
- Sensors send signals over ESP-NOW or Wi-Fi protocols.
- A Python or serial-based pipeline can log, visualize, or process signals.
- Data can be used in supervised ML pipelines for gesture classification or finger prediction.

## 🌱 Roadmap

The full roadmap, including near-term milestones, mid-term ecosystem plans, the
ten-year vision, and the disclosed business structure, lives in
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

Quick summary of where we are (June 2026):

- **Now shipping:** FlexGrid V4 dev kits (10 units, first 3 deployed)
- **In progress:** OpenMuscle-Hub housekeeping, LASK5 repo migration, public training dataset, VR/XR client extraction
- **Planned:** Nonprofit + for-profit incorporation, native VR app, mobile/Android app, V5 hardware with bridge PCB

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the full picture.
